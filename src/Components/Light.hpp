/* The Plan:
 * So there is going to be one unified lighting shader that builds our shadow map.
 * There will be a bool uniform, Sampler uniform for Dynamic Geomatry (That use vertex displacement - like Terrain)
 * If the bool is enabled we will sample the Sampler2D.
 * Once all objects are rendered for a particular light
 *
